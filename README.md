# Truth Table Generator
This repository holds my first ever project that utilizes Java's **Swing** library as a GUI. 
The truth table generator parses user inputs (propostional logic expressions) and returns a truth table

## How it Works
* The program uses Data Structures like `Queues`, `Stacks`,and  `Arraylist` even `LinkedLists` which is used for the Queue implementation through polymorphism
  to handle parsing logical expressions.
* A truth table is then generated following the conventions of **propositions** and **logical operations**.
* The resultant table is then displayed using the **GUI** .
* This project features concepts I learned from **Discrete mathematics**, **Object Oriented Programming**, and **Data Structures**.
