# Projects
This repository contains all personal projects I have worked on outside of the classroom and are solely mine.
1. Truth Table Generator: Utilizes java.swing and several data structures like queues, stacks, arraylists e.t.c. to perform operations on simple 
propositional logic problems. Supports ternary operations and beyond and features a help page to refer to.
